# Memory Encryption and Decryption Project

## Description

This project demonstrates various functionalities related to memory encryption and decryption using the OpenSSL library. The main functionalities include simulating memory usage, measuring memory usage, encrypting and decrypting memory, saving and loading encrypted data, performing memory dumps, and more.

## Features

1. **Simulate Memory Usage**: Encrypt and decrypt a sample memory content.
2. **Measure Memory Usage**: Allocate and free memory securely.
3. **Demonstrate Encryption and Decryption**: Show the process of encrypting and decrypting a sample memory content.
4. **Save Encrypted Data to File**: Save encrypted memory content to a file.
5. **Load Encrypted Data from File and Decrypt**: Load and decrypt data from a file.
6. **Memory Dump**: Display memory content in hexadecimal and ASCII format.
7. **Encrypt/Decrypt User Input**: Encrypt and decrypt user-provided input.
8. **Exit**: Exit the program.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (g++)
- OpenSSL Library
- Windows Operating System

## How to Run

### Step 1: Navigate to the Directory

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd "/d/College Codes/Sem4/C++/project"
```

### Step 2: Compile the Project

Compile the project using the g++ compiler:

```sh
g++ -o project.exe project.cpp -LC:/OpenSSL-Win64/lib -lssl -lcrypto -IC:/OpenSSL-Win64/include
```

### Step 3: Verify the Compiled Executable

Ensure that the executable file has been created:

```sh
ls
```

You should see `project.exe` listed in the directory.

### Step 4: Run the Compiled Executable

Execute the compiled program:

```sh
./project.exe
```

If the program runs successfully, you will see a menu with various options corresponding to the features listed above.

## Usage

When the program is running, you will be prompted with a menu to select an option. Enter the number corresponding to the desired functionality and follow any additional prompts.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the program and simulate memory usage:

1. Run the executable:

    ```sh
    ./project.exe
    ```

2. Enter `1` to select "Simulate Memory Usage".

    ```
    Enter option: 1
    ```

3. You will see the encrypted memory content displayed.

    ```
    Encrypted Memory Content: ~╡╠ó↓÷<╥╠xN/äs£i╗♦╞¡î 1₧♦TÜ α∩Φ
    ```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the OpenSSL library is correctly installed and the paths to the library and include files are correct.
- If you encounter any compilation errors, verify that the project files and OpenSSL installation are in the correct locations.
- For issues related to memory allocation, ensure sufficient memory is available on your system.
